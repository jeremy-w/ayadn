## To do

- check every error scenario possible on the user + API side
- learn to run tests, rspec, ...
- replace the last 'curl' calls with ruby (multipart) upload
- handle some "connection lost, trying again in xx sec" things
- re-organise files for future gem generation
- change and simplify the classes 
- make it more modular
- implement some solid error handling
- secure and sanitize input argv
- get rid of the global variables
- better colorization for replies and mentions
- show current options
- show list of commands
- create branches for experimental purposes
- clean up and DRY

## Next

- a lot of new secret features, mwahaha
- some other ones not so secret:
    - backup all your files
    - save/bookmark conversations (for backup/reference purposes)
    - live character countdown including Markdown detection
    - discover channels
    - follow a conversation in real time
    - more options activable from the app itself
    - export posts/streams to different formats
    - semantic questions like "does user x follow user x"
    - log mode: database all the things
    - flag user(s) or hashtag(s) + colorize their posts
- new options:
    - configurable path
    - pagination activated/deactivated
    - color sets
    - include/exclude elements of the headline

Most of these new feature will depend on how I'm gonna implement the "To do" list first. Some of them may never be actually implemented. Time will tell.
